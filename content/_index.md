I am an autodidact, information scientist, self-taught software developer and decorated pro debater. I have a bachelor's degree in Library and Information Science from Imo State University(Second Class Upper Division, 4.28/5.0). I am proficient in Javascript, Go, several programming frameworks, paradigms and databases . I previously worked at [BLAS Initiative](https://blasinitiative.org/) where i was an evangelist for competitive debating and literary activities in schools and co-organized/co-hosted rural outreaches and radio programs for cancer awareness while moonlighting as a debate coach for the Imo state University and University of Nigeria debating societies. I am interested in applications of software engineering, information science and critical thinking to emergent problems within complex domains.
